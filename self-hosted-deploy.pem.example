# This is an example PEM file template
# Replace this file with your actual SSH private key for deployment
# 
# To generate a new SSH key pair:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f self-hosted-deploy.pem
# 
# Then copy the public key (self-hosted-deploy.pem.pub) to your server:
# ssh-copy-id -i self-hosted-deploy.pem.pub ubuntu@your.server.ip
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit the actual PEM file to version control!
# This file should be kept secure and not shared publicly.
